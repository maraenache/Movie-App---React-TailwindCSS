3. Results display instantly in a clean, scrollable list with key movie info.
4. User searches are **tracked and stored** on Appwrite backend.
5. The **Trending Movies** carousel dynamically updates based on stored search popularity.
6. Entire UI is styled with Tailwind CSS for fast, responsive rendering.
